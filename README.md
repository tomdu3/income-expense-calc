# Income Expense Calculator

## Project Description

The **Income Expense Calculator** is a web-based application designed to help users manage their finances by tracking income and expenses. Users can add, edit, and delete entries, filter data by type (income, expense, or all), and view their total income, total expenses, and net balance. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data persistence enabled through local storage. The project implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to ensure a seamless user experience.
